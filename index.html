            April 8th:
        </h2>
        <h3><i>Morning</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Woke up ealier than usual on this Thurday morning, since I had to go the gym early since had business to do later</li>
            <li>After the was done working out at the gym I spent about an hour relaxing and showering, and another hour to do some small homework assignments</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Afternoon</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My sister asked me to help her out with cooking a new japanese dish called cold soba, so we decided to go to the asian market to look for some ingredients</li>
            <li>We stopped by the mall on our was there and it has been a while since I walked into one. It felt very empty honestly.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Evening to Night</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the moment where I realized I had a lot more responsibilities than I initially anticipated</li>
            <li>While I thought I only had statistics homework, I also had to study for a physics quiz I felt under prepared for</li>
            <li>So I ended up stuggling to finish my stats homework as fast as possible to study for the quiz. During this I tried the cold soba. It was decent, but I was not a fan of the dish... maybe I messed up but I am not sure.</li>

            <li>I felt so tired after the test I just knocked out after it</li>
        </ul>

            April 9th:
        </h2>
        <h3><i>Morning</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I had my friend's dad come over to my place today to help my mom fix her car's brake pads. It seems that we needed to replace them before we damage the rotors</li>
            <li>We also made some fried rice for them to take as a gift for the help</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Afternoon</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>After we checked out the car I went over to my friend's house to hang out for the day. There was this movie that reminded us of the movie <strong>Room</strong> called <strong>The girl in the basement</strong></li>
            <li>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyPEvkI_FXc&ab_channel=SpoilerGods</li>
            <li>The movie was alright, the acting of the main antagonist of the film had really bad acting though :/</li>

        </ul>
        <h3><i>Evening to Night</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We had our other friend stop by since we have not seen him in a while. He was doing fine</li>
            <li>It was fun, we ordered some pizza and watched some of the new Justice League film, which was pretty good. We did not finish because... the film is 4 hours</li>
        </ul>

            April 10th:
        </h2>
        <h3><i>Morning</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My friend woke me up around 6 in the morning because she could not sleep, since her cat woke her up. I wanted to go back aslep, but since I was woken up I could not go back to sleep too</li>
            <li>As a reward for staying up though, she got me some tamales which were pretty bomb</li>
            <li>She was scrolling through tik tok so we spent the rest of the morning watching those small videos</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Afternoon</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We wanted to stop by the thrift store to look for some hidden gems</li>
            <li>To my suprise I was able to find a quarter zip jacket from UC San Deigo in my size. It was my first time seeing my school's merch here. We usually find stuff from UCLA</li>
            <li>After that we got some boba and headed home to take a nap because we were both tired</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><i>Evening to Night</i></h3>
            <p>I went back home to finally start on my homework for the weekend, and now my cat is chilling on my lap as I write HTML</p>
